### Test 1: Agent Processes Messages

**What we're testing:** Agent can analyze unread messages and suggest actions

**Steps:**

1. **Create test messages from another account** (use a friend's phone or another device):
   - Fan message: "OMG I love your content! You're amazing! ðŸ”¥"
   - FAQ message: "Hey, what are your rates for sponsored posts?"
   - Business message: "Hi, I represent Nike. We'd like to partner with you for a $5000 campaign. Are you interested?"
   - Spam message: "Click here for FREE followers! Limited time offer!!!"

2. **Run the agent**:
   - Go to Menu â†’ Smart Replies (look for red badge if there are pending suggestions)
   - Tap "Run Agent Now"
   - Wait 10-20 seconds (AI is processing)
   - **Auto-navigates to Suggested Actions** if suggestions were created

3. **Verify suggested actions**:
   - You should see 4 suggested actions with:
     - âœ… **Sender's name and photo** at the top
     - âœ… **Original message** in gray box
     - âœ… **Actual message timestamp** (e.g., "2 hours ago", not "less than a minute ago")
     - âœ… **Fan message** â†’ Suggested friendly response
     - âœ… **FAQ message** â†’ Suggested FAQ answer
     - âœ… **Business message** â†’ Flagged for review (with "View Chat" button)

4. **Test running agent again**:
   - Go back to Menu â†’ Smart Replies
   - Tap "Run Agent Now" again
   - Should show: "Processed 0 messages, No new suggestions"
   - **Why:** Agent now tracks processed messages, won't re-suggest

5. **Test accessing previous suggestions**:
   - Go to Menu â†’ Smart Replies
   - See pending count (should show how many are left)
   - Tap "Review Suggestions" button
   - Opens Suggested Actions with remaining suggestions
   - **Why:** Can always access suggestions, even if agent didn't just run

**Expected Results:**
