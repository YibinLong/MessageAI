# Code Development Rules

## General:
- Follow user's beginner-friendly explanation requirement
- Explain WHY code is written and WHAT it does
- No automatic .md file creation unless explicitly requested OR if you think it would help a lot in the future for documentation/debugging. If so, ask the user first and explain why it would be helpful/essential.
- Prioritize code quality and readability over complexity

## File Operations:
- Always use existing files when possible
- Ask before creating new files if intent is unclear
- Clean up temporary files after use

## Project-Specific Context:
- This is a WhatsApp clone built with React Native
- User is a beginner in full-stack web apps
- Follow TASK_LIST.md for implementation order
- Reference PRD.md for feature specifications
